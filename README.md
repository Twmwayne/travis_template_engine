# travis_template_engine

Team Generator is a Node.js command line application that uses Javascript coding, html templates and CSS/Bootcamp styling to generate a final HTML file showing a simulated software engineering team. The application utilizes an Employee class to create templates for the Manager, Engineer and Intern demographics and Inquirer NPM package to generate a set of user input prompts to provide the team demographic information.

The application is initally tested using the Node Jest package to help optimize the class and subclass coding. Once the class files pass the unit tests, the user completes the prompts, the application runs the inputs through the Employee subclass templates to create the final HTML file.

I designed and created this application to further demonstrate Node.js proficiency, and understanding of ES6 classes to generate a command line application.

Key Features:

Use of Node.js to create a command line application.

Use of Javascript ES6 classes and subclasses and Inquirer package to dynamically generate a final engineering team roster file.
